# LedgerShield 🛡️

LedgerShield is a stateful, adversarial benchmark for AI agents operating inside enterprise accounts-payable workflows. Instead of asking a model to classify one document, LedgerShield asks it to investigate, unlock hidden evidence, choose controls, withstand pressure, and submit a proof-carrying decision under budget and step limits.

## Why This Matters

Real-world payment fraud is expensive and operationally messy. In the FBI IC3 2023 report, business email compromise (BEC) generated **21,489 complaints and more than $2.9 billion in reported losses**, while total cybercrime losses exceeded **$12.5 billion**. LedgerShield turns that risk surface into an agent benchmark focused on safe decision-making, evidence quality, and control discipline instead of one-shot classification.

## What Judges Care About

LedgerShield is built to score well on real-world utility, environment design, task quality, engineering quality, and novelty because the implementation now includes:

| Dimension | What is implemented |
|---|---|
| Real-world utility | Multi-currency invoices, IBAN/SWIFT validation, SOX control modeling, AP inbox triage, campaign fraud, aging-report support |
| Environment design | Stronger PBRS reward shaping, milestone rewards, information-gain bonus, `terminated` vs `truncated`, text `render()`, formal `action_space()` and `observation_space()` |
| Task and grader quality | 21 curated benchmark cases, semantic counterfactual scoring, stricter degenerate-submission penalties, generated holdout suites, contrastive benign twins |
| Code quality | Comprehensive docstrings, shared pytest fixtures, dedicated tests for grading/currency/compliance/curriculum, GitHub Actions CI, narrower exception handling, typed internal return contracts |
| Creativity and novelty | Dec-POMDP watchdog mode, dynamic curriculum adaptation, campaign-level fraud reasoning, 16 attack types across identity/document/process/APT categories |

## Benchmark At A Glance

| Item | Value |
|---|---:|
| Public benchmark cases | 21 curated base cases |
| Task families | 5 (`task_a` through `task_e`) |
| Attack types | 16 |
| Default loader behavior | 21 benchmark cases + 24 generated challenge variants = 45 loaded cases |
| Optional generated suites | challenge variants, holdout variants, contrastive benign twins |
| Formal model | finite-horizon POMDP |
| Server runtime | FastAPI / OpenEnv-compatible |

### Task coverage

| Task | Count | Focus |
|---|---:|---|
| Task A | 4 | proof-carrying invoice extraction, multilingual and multi-currency artifacts |
| Task B | 5 | three-way match, receipt gaps, quantity/tax discrepancies |
| Task C | 4 | duplicate detection, cross-vendor fraud, approval-threshold evasion |
| Task D | 6 | AP inbox/BEC triage, workflow override, CEO fraud, benign vendor updates |
| Task E | 2 | coordinated campaigns and supply-chain-compromise APT scenarios |

## What The Agent Must Actually Do

LedgerShield episodes are partially observable. Agents start with visible documents and must use tools and interventions to discover the rest.

Investigation tools:

- `zoom`, `get_doc_crop`, `ocr`
- `lookup_vendor`, `lookup_vendor_history`, `lookup_policy`
- `lookup_po`, `lookup_receipt`, `search_ledger`
- `inspect_email_thread`, `compare_bank_account`

Interventions:

- `request_callback_verification`
- `freeze_vendor_profile`
- `request_bank_change_approval_chain`
- `request_po_reconciliation`
- `request_additional_receipt_evidence`
- `route_to_procurement`
- `route_to_security`
- `flag_duplicate_cluster_review`
- `create_human_handoff`

Final action:

- `submit_decision`

The submission is not just a label. Strong agents are expected to return structured decisions with grounded `reason_codes`, `policy_checks`, `evidence_map`, and task-specific fields like duplicates, campaign signals, discrepancies, or extracted invoice fields.

### Agent capability tiers

The inference agent (`inference.py`) uses a `ModelCapabilityProfile` that adapts behavior to model strength:

| Tier | Capability score | Plan mode | Repair level | Budget bonus |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Elite | ≥ 5.0 | coverage | grounded | +2 investigation, +2 intervention |
| Strong | ≥ 4.5 | hybrid | partial | +1 investigation, +1 intervention |
| Standard | < 4.5 | LLM-first | none | baseline |

Weaker models get more structured guardrails and stricter evidence validation; stronger models get richer planning and repair budgets.

### Smart signal derivation

The agent and server now share improved signal-extraction logic:

- **Domain alignment inference** — sender domains are compared against vendor-approved domains using token overlap, not just exact match. This catches spoofs like `ceo@acme-corp.com` vs approved `acme.com`.
- **Composite risk flags** — `bank_override_attempt` now requires `bank_change_language` *and* a risk amplifier (domain mismatch, callback discouragement, policy override, or urgency). Isolated bank language no longer triggers false fraud flags.
- **PAY evidence** — safe PAY decisions now carry constructive evidence (verified bank, verified sender, cleared duplicates) instead of empty evidence maps. This avoids degenerate-evidence penalties on benign cases.

## Upgrade Snapshot

The benchmark upgrade work is reflected in the codebase across five phases:

| Phase | Highlights |
|---|---|
| Phase 1: Real-world utility | `server/currency_engine.py`, `server/compliance_engine.py`, richer payment artifacts, aging-report support |
| Phase 2: Task and grader quality | 21 curated cases, semantic counterfactual grading, tighter degenerate penalties, generated holdouts |
| Phase 3: Environment design | `SHAPING_SCALE=0.35`, `INFO_GAIN_BONUS=0.08`, milestone rewards, Gymnasium-style truncation semantics, text rendering, formal spaces |
| Phase 4: Code quality | docstrings across core modules, `tests/conftest.py`, CI workflow, `TypedDict` internal returns |
| Phase 5: Creativity and novelty | Dec-POMDP watchdog mode, curriculum adaptation, 16-attack library, exploration bonus integrated into `step()` |

### Recent patch-level changes

| Change | Where | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `DEGENERATE_EVIDENCE_CAP` applied correctly | `server/grading.py` | Bug fix: empty evidence now correctly receives cap value instead of collapsing to `0.0` |
| Model capability profiles and tiered agent behavior | `inference.py` | Agent adapts investigation/repair strategy based on model tier (elite/strong/standard) |
| Composite `bank_override_attempt` signal | `server/tools.py`, `task_c_guardrails.py`, `task_d_guardrails.py` | Bank override flag now requires bank-change language *plus* a risk amplifier — reduces false positives |
| Domain alignment via token overlap | `server/tools.py`, `inference.py` | Catches spoofs where sender domain shares tokens with vendor name but is not an exact match |
| Constructive PAY evidence maps | `task_c_guardrails.py`, `task_d_guardrails.py` | Safe PAY decisions carry verified-bank / cleared-duplicates evidence instead of empty maps |
| Per-model capability profiles in live comparison | `compare_models_live.py` | Records model tier, capability score, and monotonic strength checks alongside scores |
| `pytest` config in `pyproject.toml` | `pyproject.toml` | Asyncio mode, markers, deprecation-warning filters |

## Benchmarking Story

LedgerShield is not just a server. It includes a full evaluation stack:

- `benchmark_report.py` scores the public benchmark, generated holdout suites, and contrastive adversarial/benign pairs.
- `compare_models_live.py` runs live head-to-head evaluations with per-model capability profiles and writes per-case debug traces including monotonic strength ordering checks.
- `live_model_comparison_debug/` stores action traces, planning traces, score breakdowns, and system state snapshots for diagnosis.
- `/leaderboard` and `/benchmark-report` expose report artifacts through the API when generated.

### Latest local live comparison

The latest local `compare_models_live.py` snapshot in this workspace was generated on **April 8, 2026** from the full 21-case public benchmark using:

```bash
python compare_models_live.py \
  --models gpt-3.5-turbo,gpt-4o,gpt-5.4 \
  --output live_model_comparison.json
```

| Model | Tier | Capability | Average Score | Success Rate | Min | Max | API Calls |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| `gpt-3.5-turbo` | `standard` | 3.2 | 0.7658 | 42.9% | 0.13 | 0.99 | 64 |
| `gpt-4o` | `strong` | 4.6 | 0.9267 | 100.0% | 0.87 | 0.99 | 63 |
| `gpt-5.4` | `elite` | 5.4 | 0.9276 | 100.0% | 0.87 | 0.99 | 34 |

Capability ordering check: `PASS`

Failed cases for the weakest model:

- `CASE-B-003`
- `CASE-C-001`
- `CASE-C-002`
- `CASE-C-003`
- `CASE-D-001` through `CASE-D-006`
- `CASE-E-001`, `CASE-E-002`

Published benchmark metadata in [`openenv.yaml`](./openenv.yaml) records meaningful public-vs-holdout separation:

| Agent | Public mean | Holdout mean | Holdout consistent pass rate |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Deterministic baseline | 0.9674 | 0.6649 | 0.6190 |
| Published external LLM agent | not listed | 0.3847 | 0.2222 |

That gap is deliberate: the benchmark looks easy on clean public cases and much harder on generated holdouts, adversarial variants, and expert Task E scenarios.

## Safety Note

LedgerShield is a benchmark and simulation environment. It models payment-integrity risk and enterprise controls, but it is not a production fraud platform and should not be used to approve or block real payments without independent controls, audit, and governance.
